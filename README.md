The file includes all the data and codes.

Feeding assay data.csv includes the male and female gametocytemia (measured by PfMGET and Pfs25 qRT-PCR respectively) and the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts.

Uninfected_mosquito.csv and Infected_mosquito.csv are the mosquito survival data.

ABC-SMC_vector.R includes the codes for parameter estimation and the results are saved in fitting_result.RData.

Sensitivityanalysis.R includes the codes for determining the relative contributions of human and mosquito factors to the probability of human-to-mosquito transmission (i.e., PRCC and sensitivity anlysis) and assessing relationship between parasitemia and the transmission probability. 

Death rate.R includes the code for estimating the death rate of mosquiotes.
